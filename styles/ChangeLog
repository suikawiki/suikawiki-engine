	* sw-classes.css: New style sheet.

	* sw.css: a:hover did not work because of specificity.  Typo
	fixed.  Use dashed underline for wiki-internal links so that a
	paragraph with a lot of links looks less ugly.  Set margin between
	adjucent links.  sw:insert and sw:delete elements that are
	children of the article element should be rendered as blocks.
	Underlines replaced by borders to avoid ugly styling when an
	underlined element is contained within a bordered element.  Set
	border to form elements.
